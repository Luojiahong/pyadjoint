      "`Pyadjoint` utilizes [ObsPy](http://obspy.org) (and some of its dependencies) for the processing and data handling. As a first step, please follow the [installation instructions of ObsPy](https://github.com/obspy/obspy/wiki#installation) for your given platform (we recommend the installation with [Anaconda](https://github.com/obspy/obspy/wiki/Installation-via-Anaconda) as it will most likely result in the least amount of problems). `Pyadjoint` should work with Python versions 2.6, 2.7, 3.3, and 3.4 (mainly depends on the used ObsPy version). To install it, best use `pip` (not working yet!):\n",
