Pyadjoint
=========

``Pyadjoint`` is a Python package to measure misfit and calculate
adjoint sources.

Installation
------------

``Pyadjoint`` utilizes `ObsPy <http://obspy.org>`_ (and some of its
dependencies) for the processing and data handling. As a first step,
please follow the `installation instructions of
ObsPy <https://github.com/obspy/obspy/wiki#installation>`_ for your
given platform (we recommend the installation with
`Anaconda <https://github.com/obspy/obspy/wiki/Installation-via-Anaconda>`_
as it will most likely result in the least amount of problems).
``Pyadjoint`` should work with Python versions 2.6, 2.7, 3.3, and 3.4
(mainly depends on the used ObsPy version). To install it, best use
``pip`` (not working yet!):

::

    $ pip install pyadjoint

If you want the latest development version, or want to work on the code,
you will have to install with the help of ``git``.

::

    $ git clone https://github.com/krischer/pyadjoint.git
    $ cd pyadjoint
    $ pip install -v -e .

Tests
-----

To assure the installation is valid and everything works as expected,
run the tests with

::

    $ python -m pyadjoint.tests

Usage
-----

The first step is to import ObsPy and Pyadjoint.

.. code:: python

    import obspy
    import pyadjoint
Logging
-------

By default, ``Pyadjoint`` is fairly quiet and will only raise exceptions
and warnings in case they occur. ``Pyadjoint`` utilizes Python's
`logging facilities <https://docs.python.org/2/library/logging.html>`_
so if you want more information you can hook into them. This approach is
very flexible as it allows you to install custom logging handlers and
channels.

.. code:: python

    import logging
    logger = logging.getLogger("pyadjoint")
    logger.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)
